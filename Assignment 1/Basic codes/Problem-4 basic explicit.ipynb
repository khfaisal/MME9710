    "# Discussion on Determination of Required Number of Iterations for Convergence for Steel\n",
    "\n",
    "Required number of iterations have been determined for steel. To do this, four convergence criteria were taken into consideration and these are 1e-8, 1e-13, 1e-15, 1e-17. After running the code for the above-mentioned convergence criteria, it was observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-8: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 8 iterations (from 0 to 7). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-13: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 11 iterations (from 0 to 11). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-15: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 13 iterations (from 0 to 12). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-17: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 13 iterations (from 0 to 12). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion: \n",
    "As for the last two consecutive convergence criteria i.e., 1e-15 and 1e-17, 13 iterations were enough for convergence to take place for both 6 and 10 control volumes, so required number of iterations for steel is determined to be 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "One of the most vital procedures of an iterative solution’s convergence is measuring the residual. Residual straight away enumerates the error in the solution of the system of equations. In Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis, the residual quantifies the local imbalance of a conserved variable in each control volume. So, each cell in the model will have its individual residual value for each of the equations being solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exact zero can never be achieved in an iterative numerical solution. However, the lower the residual value is, the more numerically correct the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This residual value which is involved with the quantification of local imbalance of conserved cell, depends upon the source term. If the source term is either zero or a constant or very small, then the local imbalance of conserved cell is also very small hence negligible and as a result convergence takes place with very few number of iterations even 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, the source term is neither zero nor constant. Rather, the source term is very big. It is anticipated that, because of this reason, convergence took place after 13 iterations.\n",

    "Even though above two graphs represent the same result, but they are presented in different ways. From the first graph, it is realizable that it represents the data for both 6 and 10 control volumes. The second graph also represents data for both 6 and 10 control volumes but as they have overlapped each other so it is difficult to differentiate from each other. From this, it can be concluded that 6 control volumes are enough to obtain a grid independent solution"

    "Negligence of linearization coefficient can not be taken as a reason of divergence as with the same consideration, solution converged for steel. Rather, this divergence of residuals has direct dependence on the thermal conductivity k. \n",
