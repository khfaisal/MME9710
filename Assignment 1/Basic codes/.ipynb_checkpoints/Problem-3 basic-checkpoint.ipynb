    "A plane wall $L$ = 0.1 [m] thick with a thermal conductivity of $k$ = 26 [W/m$\\cdot$K] is exposed to an environment at an ambient temperature of 50 [$^\\circ$C] on one side and an environment of 40 [$^\\circ$C] on the other side. The convection coefficient at the exposed surfaces is estimated to be $h$ = 280 [W/m$^2\\cdot$K]. If heat is generated uniformly within the wall at a rate 50,000 [W/m$^3$], determine the surface temperatures of the walls, and the location and value of the maximum temperature inside the wall. Compare your result to the analytical result, which can be obtained from a heat transfer textbook."

    "A wall of infinite length with one side exposed to environment at a temperature of 40 oC and the other side is exposed to environment at a temperature of 50 oC. Heat is being generated internally in the wall at a uniform rate throughout the wall. Heat transfers form the wall to the exposed walls by conduction and to the ambient by convection. An element from the wall is taken into consideration and a zero gradient across the internal surfaces of this element is assumed. Hence, the only heat transfer considered is in the x-direction. "

    "# Discussion on Determination of Required Number of Iterations for Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Required number of iterations for convergence have been determined. To do this, two convergence criteria were taken into consideration and these are 1e-6, 1e-10. After running the code for the above-mentioned convergence criteria, it was observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-6: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 2 iterations (from 0 to 1). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-10: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 2 iterations (from 0 to 1). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion: \n",
    "As for both consecutive convergence criteria i.e., 1e-6 and 1e-10, 2 iterations (from 0 to 1) were enough for convergence to take place for both 6 and 10 control volumes, so required number of iterations for steel is determined to be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "One of the most vital procedures of an iterative solution’s convergence is measuring the residual. Residual straight away enumerates the error in the solution of the system of equations. In Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis, the residual quantifies the local imbalance of a conserved variable in each control volume. So, each cell in the model will have its individual residual value for each of the equations being solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exact zero can never be achieved in an iterative numerical solution. However, the lower the residual value is, the more numerically correct the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This residual value which is involved with the quantification of local imbalance of conserved cell, depends upon the source term. If the source term is either zero or a constant or very small, then the local imbalance of conserved cell is also very small hence negligible and as a result convergence takes place with very few number of iterations even 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, the source term is constant. It is anticipated that, because of this reason, convergence took place very quickly.\n"

    "Even though above two graphs represent the same result, but they are presented in different ways. From the first graph, it is realizable that it represents the data for both 6 and 10 control volumes. The second graph also represents data for both 6 and 10 control volumes but as they have overlapped each other so it is difficult to differentiate from each other. From this, it can be concluded that 6 control volumes are enough to obtain a grid independent solution\n"
