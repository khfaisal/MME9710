Heat transfer by convection from the exposed surfaces of the bar is considered negligible. This problem is solved for the temperature field in the bar. The expected profile of temperature in the bar is a linear profile connecting the maximum temperature at the 100oC end and the minimum temperature at the 0oC end.  \n",

    "# Discussion on Determination of Required Number of Iterations for Convergence\n",
    "Required number of iterations for convergence have been determined. To do this, two convergence criteria were taken into consideration and these are 1e-6, 1e-8. After running the code for the above-mentioned convergence criteria, it was observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-6: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 2 iterations (from 0 to 1). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At convergence criteria 1e-8: \n",
    "Convergence takes place after 2 iterations (from 0 to 1). And it happened for both number of control volumes (i.e., ncv = 6 & ncv = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion: \n",
    "As for both consecutive convergence criteria i.e., 1e-6 and 1e-8, 2 iterations (from 0 to 1) were enough for convergence to take place for both 6 and 10 control volumes, so required number of iterations for steel is determined to be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "One of the most vital procedures of an iterative solution’s convergence is measuring the residual. Residual straight away enumerates the error in the solution of the system of equations. In Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis, the residual quantifies the local imbalance of a conserved variable in each control volume. So, each cell in the model will have its individual residual value for each of the equations being solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exact zero can never be achieved in an iterative numerical solution. However, the lower the residual value is, the more numerically correct the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This residual value which is involved with the quantification of local imbalance of conserved cell, depends upon the source term. If the source term is either zero or a constant or very small, then the local imbalance of conserved cell is also very small hence negligible and as a result convergence takes place with very few number of iterations even 1 or 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, the source term is zero. It is anticipated that, because of this reason, convergence took place very quickly.\n",

    "Even though above two graphs represent the same result, but they are presented in different ways. From the first graph, it is realizable that it represents the data for both 6 and 10 control volumes. The second graph also represents data for both 6 and 10 control volumes but as they have overlapped each other so it is difficult to differentiate from each other. From this, it can be concluded that 6 control volumes are enough to obtain a grid independent solution"

Thus, in case of one dimensional system, temperature variation is noticed in one direction only and heat transfer takes place solely in that direction. Such conditions are called as steady state conditions. Both the analytical and computational result are inline with all the facts described above."
